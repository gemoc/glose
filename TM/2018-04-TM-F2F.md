** Program: **

    * <u>04/10/2018:</u>
        * *from 9:00AM to 6:00PM:* code camp: no real progam, the goal here is technical exchange between partners. all ideas to be addressed can be found here: [Gitlab](https://gitlab.inria.fr/glose/management/tree/master/2018-04-TM-F2F)
        * *around 12:00:* we will eventually eat something somewhere, I guess :)

    * <u>04/11/2018:</u>
        * *from 08:00 to 09:00:* introduction and quick news about the project life (deliverable and co) (Kairos)
        * *from 09:00 to 10:30:* WP1: quick outline of the drone model and feedback from the team about the drone model, requirements for a meaningfull example (Safran)
        * *from 10:30 to 11:00:* coffee break
        * *from 11:00 to 12:30:* WP1: quick presentation of the drone model from Dassault (Hycomes)
