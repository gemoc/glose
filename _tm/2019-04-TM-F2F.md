## Program:

  * __04/10/2018:__
     * *from 9:00AM to 6:00PM:* code camp: no real progam, the goal here is technical exchange between partners. all ideas to be addressed can be found here: [Gitlab](https://gitlab.inria.fr/glose/management/blob/master/2018-04-TM-F2F/ideas.md)
     * *around 12:00:* we will eventually eat something somewhere, I guess :)
     * *evening:* diner on our own to be defined collectively
  * __04/11/2018:__
     * *08:00 to 09:00:* introduction and quick news about the project life (deliverable and co) (Kairos)
     * *09:00 to 10:30:* WP1: quick outline of the drone model and feedback from the team about the drone model, requirements for a meaningfull example (Safran)
     * *<font color="grey">10:30 to 11:00: coffee break</font>*
     * *11:00 to 12:30:* WP1: quick presentation of the drone model from Dassault (Hycomes)
     * *<font color="grey">12:30 to 14:00: lunch time</font>*
     * *14:00 to 15:30:* WP2: presentation of the trace manipulation operators. Illustration on use cases; relations with concurrent models (Sm@rt)
     * *<font color="grey">15:30 to 16:00: coffee break</font>*
     * *16:00 to 17:30:* WP2: definition of the problematic about trace learning (wrt the internship in CNRS ?) (DiverSE)
     * *17:30 to 18:30:* WP3: definition of parametric master algortihms (i.e., coordination algorithm) based on correspondances semantics. Problems about experimentations (Kairos)
     * *<font color="grey">from 19:30 to ...: diner at **?????**</font>*
  * __05/12/2018:__
     * *08:00 to 10:00:* WP4: presentation of SoTA approach about coordination/co-simulation of continuous time models, coordination patterns and relevant information to be exhibited (Hycomes)
     *  *<font color="grey">10:00 to 10:30: coffee break</font>*
     * *10:30 to 12:30:* brainstorming about languages, models <u>and correspondances</u> used in the example (all)
     *  *<font color="grey">12:30 to 14:00: lunch time</font>*
     * *14:00 to 15:30:* options for correspondances (or correspondance patterns) between specific models (discrete to discrete, continuous to continuous)(all)
